Data visualization
#Introduction: 

John owns a series of electronics stores and has gathered information on the sales of various smartphones.\ He has a particular interest in determining which phone has sold the most units among all the smartphones in his inventory. To achieve this goal, he requires a thorough analysis of the smartphone sales data he has collected.\ This dataset comprises several columns, including battery power, clock speed, internal memory, RAM size, touch screen, and others.  \

By exploring this dataset, John hopes to uncover patterns and trends that could aid him in making informed business decisions. As a result, he has sought your assistance in visualizing this data, allowing him to gain greater insight into the sales performance of his smartphone inventory. 
#Problem Statement: 

John is seeking a comprehensive understanding of the data points and distributions present in his dataset. Specifically, he is interested in identifying correlations between different features and their respective prices. He also wants to gauge the significance of each feature present in the dataset. To achieve this, you need to employ data visualization techniques using various plots that allow us to analyze these features. \
 By visualizing the data, you can identify any trends, outliers, or relationships that may exist between different variables. This will enable John to make more informed decisions based on the insights gained from the visualization of his data. \
